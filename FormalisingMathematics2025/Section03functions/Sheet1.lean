# Types and terms

In this sheet we'll talk a bit more about how types work in Lean, as well as learning more about
the `rw` tactic.

Lean uses something called "types" instead of sets, as its foundational
way of saying a "collection of stuff". For example, the real numbers
are a type in Lean, a group `G` is a type `G` equipped with a multiplication
and satisfying some axioms, and so on.

-- Lean is a dependently-typed language
-- Every expression has a type, and `#check` can tell you the type

#check 2
#check 17 + 4
#check π
#check rexp 1

-- (If you get the Error Lens extension in VSCode, these show up nicely)

-- Types are expressions too!

#check ℕ
#check ℝ

-- We can also make our own expressions, and give them names
def myFavouriteNumber : ℕ := 7

def yourFavouriteNumber : ℕ := sorry

#check myFavouriteNumber

-- or not give them a name
example : ℕ := 2

-- # But this isn't maths!

-- The type `Prop` contains `Prop`ositions...

#check 2 + 2 = 4
#check rexp 1 < π

#check 2 + 2 = 5
#check Irrational (rexp 1 + π)
#check myFavouriteNumber = yourFavouriteNumber

def MyDifficultProposition : Prop := ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p, n ≤ p ∧ Prime p ∧ Prime (p + 2)

def MyVeryEasyProposition : Prop := ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p, n ≤ p

-- Key! If `p : Prop`, an expression of type `p` is a proof of `p`.

-- Expressions and types, every expression has a type
-- A proof has type given by what it's proved!

-- ## Dependently typed
-- Lean is *dependently typed* (unlike C, Java, Haskell), which means that types can depend on
-- terms. Not every theorem proving language is dependently typed, but it's sometimes useful in
-- practice when formalising maths.
